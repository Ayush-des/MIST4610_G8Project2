## Dataset Description:
### Basic features & description:
The dataset provides comprehensive records of each arrest made by the NYPD from 2006 to 2024, totaling nearly 5,986,025 rows of entries across 19 columns. Sourced from data.gov, a public information repository, this dataset captures key details such as the perpetrator’s demographic information, the type of offense committed, and the location of each arrest. It offers valuable insights for analyzing crime trends, demographic patterns, and law enforcement activity across New York City over nearly two decades.

In Microsoft Excel, the data is viewable as individual rows that reference each recorded arrest and 19 columns that describe a different facet of the arrest (location, the perpetrator’s gender, etc.).

* For example, one row may contain the following information: 272061744 (arrest number/identifier), 7/29/2023 (arrest date), STRANGULATION 1ST (crime/has the perpetrator  committed this before?), 106 (offense identifier), FELONY ASSAULT (offense description), ...

### Why is this data important?
* Helps identify crime trends
  * EX: Arson was the most commonly committed crime between 2012-2015. What did our economy look like then and what trends can we stop now before they lead to this happening again?
* Asks the question → “should law enforcement allocate its resources differently?”
  * EX: If in 2023, felony assault was the most frequently reported crime in the Southeast region of NYC then after noticing this pattern, NYPD can strategically place more officers or a different unit  in the Southeast region of the city.
* Advocates for city government to the public.
  * EX: Noticing that NYPD is frequently arresting offenders of rape may increase the public’s opinion of the police department.

## Question 1: How does distribution of each of the 7 major felonies differ among each age group?
### Why is this question important?
This question is important because it allows us to see how the relationship between age and felony type has evolved over time and helps us understand which age groups are most involved in certain types of crimes. This information can inform policy decisions and resource allocation. For instance, law enforcement and community organizations can:
* Allocate more resources to age groups with higher crime rates
* Implement youth intervention programs, such as school-based initiatives and mentorship opportunities
* Strengthen adult rehabilitation efforts to reduce recidivism and support reintegration

### Analysis Conclusion
Insights from age group distribution:
* Younger arrestees (<18, 18-24) have higher rates of Robbery compared to other groups
* Middle-aged groups (25-44) dominate Felony Assault counts
* 45-64 have have higher rates of burglary than other groups
* Older cohorts (65+) show minimal arrest counts across all categories
* Rape, Murder & Non-Negl Manslaughter, and Grand Larceny of Motor Vehicles is low among all groups 


## Question 2: How does felony distribution differ among each age group?
### Why is this question important?
This question is important because understanding how felony types are distributed across different age groups can help policymakers and law enforcement agencies tailor their crime prevention strategies. Ultimately, this analysis supports more efficient and specific approaches to reducing crime and recidivism.
* Anticipate crime trends: Allows agencies to forecast surges in violent offenses and prepare proactive strategies rather than reacting after the fact.
* Optimize resource allocation: Helps police departments assign patrols, detectives, and support services to the units most likely to see increased cases.
* Guide policy and budgeting: Provides data‑driven justification for funding specialized task forces or community resources focused on the highest‐risk felony types.
* Measures policy effectiveness: If a citywide violence‑prevention initiative comes into action and the actual assault arrests come in below your forecasted baseline, that gap quantifies how much crime the program likely prevented.

### Analysis Conclusion
Based on the one-year forecast:
* Felony Assault shows the highest predicted count
* Grand Larceny and Robbery follow closely and have similar rates to each other
* Other categories have relatively flat forecasts
